POC for the Upwork Freelance Request FEMA request

There is a table on https://www.usviodr.com/fema-pa-search-by-applicant/. I believe it is rendered by Javascript. It is paginated.

I need an application that will download this table into a CSV or XLSX on a regular basis.

This is hopefully a quick one-time project. However, if it works out, I may need help on similar issues.
